Web scraping refers to the process of extracting data from websites by using automated methods. It involves writing code to navigate web pages, retrieve their HTML content, and extract specific information or data points of interest. Web scraping allows you to collect data from multiple web pages efficiently and automatically, saving time and effort compared to manual data collection

The code  performs web scraping on Flipkart to extract phone details. It collects information such as the phone's name, MRP (Maximum Retail Price), sale price, discount, rating, and features. These details are likely obtained from a search results page on Flipkart for the keyword "phone".

The resulting data is structured in a tabular format, with each column representing a specific attribute of the phones. The column names or headers are 'Name', 'MRP', 'Sale Price', 'Discount', 'Rating', and 'Features'. Each row of the resulting data would correspond to a different phone listing on Flipkart.

By scraping this information, you can analyze and compare various phone models available on Flipkart based on their prices, discounts, ratings, and features. This data can be further processed or visualized using libraries such as pandas, seaborn, or matplotlib to gain insights or make informed decisions regarding phone purchases.
